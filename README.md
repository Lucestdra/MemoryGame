# MemoryGame
This repository contains a Java-based Memory Game application, developed as part of the CENG203 course project. The project aims to create an engaging and interactive memory game using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI).
# Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game features a visually appealing and interactive interface designed with Java Swing.
Dynamic Gameplay: Users can uncover pairs of matching elements hidden behind the grid's cells, with dynamic shuffling and timers to enhance the excitement.
User Feedback: The game provides real-time feedback through pop-up dialogs, informing users about game completion, errors, and congratulatory messages.
Customizable Elements: The game includes various visual elements such as colored circles representing different values, contributing to an engaging user experience.
# Project Structure
MemoryTest Class: The main driver class responsible for initializing the game, handling user input, and managing the game logic.
MemoryPanel Class: A custom JPanel that facilitates the rendering of the game grid and individual cells.
Game Logic: The core mechanics of the memory game, including handling mouse clicks, checking for matching pairs, and managing game states.

#Usage
Launching the Game: The game starts with a graphical interface displaying a grid of concealed cells. Users can click on the cells to uncover the hidden elements.
Gameplay: Users aim to uncover matching pairs by clicking on the cells. Correct matches keep the cells open, while incorrect matches briefly display the elements before concealing them again.
Feedback: The game provides feedback through pop-up dialogs, indicating game completion or congratulatory messages upon successfully finding all matching pairs.
